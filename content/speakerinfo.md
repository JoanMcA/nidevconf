                <h2>Checklist</h2>
                  <h3><b>What you must do before the day. Backup Plans</b></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Check that your presentation works on your laptop if you are bringing one.</li>
                    <li>Your prensentation backed up on a FAT32/NTFS usb drive. Incase your laptop does not work with the presentation equipment.</li>
                    <li>Your prensentation exported as a PDF. This is incase your presentation does not work, your laptop does not work with the presentation equipment or we do not have the software on the windows machine to run your presentation. Microsoft power point is on the windows machines.</li>
                    <li>Bring any X-to-HDMI connectors you need e.g USB-C to HDMI connector, HDMI to VGA connector. Please bear in mind that some rooms (Lightning, Conference and Raked) will not have HD-compatible projectors - while we can provide HDMI-VGA connectors, please bear in mind that the available resolution may be lower.</li>
                  </ul>
                <h3>Before the day</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Get to speaker events on May 30 and Jun 6, if you can!</li>
                    <li>We recommend doing a test run with someone for feedback and to make sure you'll reach your final slides during the available time! Room MCs will be asked to keep presenters strictly to time</li>
                    <li>If you want <a href="https://joind.in/event/northern-ireland-developer-conference-2018">joind.in feedback</a>, let us know at inbox@nidevconf.com (subject line "Feedback on joind.in"). We can mark this with an "L", if you ask, so commenters recognise you are starting out.</li>
                    <li>Let us know if you will use your laptop or need one available. Windows machines are already connected to the presentation equipment.</li>
                    <li>Include any links to your Twitter / professional networks</li>
                    <li>Put some thought into making your <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/">presentation accessible</a></li>
                  </ul>
                <h3>On the day</h3>
                <h4>Lightning (5-10min)</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Get to the room early and keep an eye on the progress, as lightning talk start timing is not 100% guaranteed!</li>
                    <li>If the MC needs to stand up signal you have run out of time, please finish as succinctly as possible</li>
                    <li>Please note that we do not include time for questions - we recommend you take any questions outside, or add a session to the Open Space</li>
                  </ul>
                <h4>Full Talks (up to 30min)</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Check in with your MC earlier in day</li>
                    <li>Check your presentation is working</li>
                    <li>Get to room at least 5min before your talk (10min if you haven't already seen MC!)</li>
                    <li>Watch for MC signalling that you are getting close to time</li>
                    <li>If the MC needs to stand up signal you have run out of time, please finish as succinctly as possible</li>
                    <li>Do not feel under pressure to take questions, and ask to take them outside, if preferred -- for further discussion, we recommend using the Open Space (details in the Atrium)</li>
                    <li>If desired, you should include time for questions <em>during</em> your 30min slot</li>
                    <li>Allow a quick interstitial-slides swapover, by unplugging your laptop quickly</li>
                  </ul>
                <br/>
                <h2>Presenting</h2>
                <p>Each room will have an MC and a room monitor - please introduce yourself to the MC in your room earlier than
                your slot, so they can recognise you, and please arrive early in the 10 minute break before your slot to get
                set up.</p>
                <p>You have 30 mins to present, and may include questions in that if desired. Certain rooms are more focused
                on accessible talks, where the MC will assume you do not plan to take questions unless you ask. Please check
                your timing to ensure you can finish on time - we have a lot of people changing places in a short space of time,
                so precise timing will keep the event safe and enjoyable.</p>
