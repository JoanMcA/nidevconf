                  </li>
                  <li>On the day
                  <ul>
                    <li>Check in with your MC earlier in day</li>
                    <li>Get to room at least 5min before your talk (10min if you haven't already seen MC!)</li>
                    <li>Check your presentation is working</li>
                    <li>Watch for MC signalling that you are getting close to time</li>
                    <li>If the MC needs to stand up signal you have run out of time, please finish as succinctly as possible</li>
                    <li>Do not feel under pressure to take questions, and ask to take them outside, if preferred</li>
                    <li>Allow a quick interstitial-slides swapover, by unplugging your laptop quickly</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>            
                <h2>Presenting</h2>
                <p>Each room will have an MC and a room monitor - please introduce yourself the MC in your room earlier than
                your slot, so they can recognise you, and please arrive early in the 10 minute break before your slot to get
                set up.</p>          
                <p>You have 30 mins to present, and may include questions in that if desired. Certain rooms are more focused
                on accessible talks, where the MC will assume you do not plan to take questions unless you ask. Please check
                your timing to ensure you can finish on time - we have a lot of people changing places in a short space of time,
                so precise timing will keep the event safe and enjoyable.</p>
