                        <li><strong>Standard price</strong> - <strong>£45</strong> / £25 concession</li>
                        <li><strong>Last Minute</strong>: <strong>£45</strong> / £25 concession but <strong>without lunch</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    Concessionary prices are for students, unwaged etc.<br/>
                    Standard tickets are available until we hit maximum catering numbers. Last Minute tickets will NOT include lunch.

                <h3>I'd love to come but I can't afford it</h3>
                <p>
                    Come anyway! Choose an "honesty" ticket and just pay whatever you can afford.
                </p>
                <h3>Great! Where do I get tickets?</h3>
