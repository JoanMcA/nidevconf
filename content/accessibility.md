                <h1>Access and Accessibility</h1>

                <p>We are keen to make this event as accessible to the widest group of technologists as we can. While we aim to preemptively address needs where possible, if you do have any concerns about the level of access provided, or specific requirements, please get in touch via <a href='mailto:inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a> or one of our organizing team directly.</p>

                <p>Carers are welcome free-of-charge - our system will allow self-selected ticket booking at zero cost, but if preferred, you are welcome to contact us to book a ticket for a carer directly.</p>

                <p>While we will not be able to provide live captioning, if you would be benefited by suitable seat reservation, or there are other ways we can facilitate your experience of the event, please get in touch via <a href='mailto:inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a> or one of our organizing team directly. We do have some preparation space that may be used as a quieter area, however, if find you need access to a suitable space during the day, please let one of our organizing team know.</p>

                <p><em>Full venue accessibility will be available shortly.</em></p>

                <p>If there is information that you feel should be here, but is not, please let us know at <a href='inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a>.</p>
