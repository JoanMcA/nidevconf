                <h1>Access and Accessibility</h1>

                <p>We are keen to make this event as accessible to the widest group of technologists as we can. While we aim to preemptively address needs where possible, if you do have any concerns about the level of access provided, or specific requirements, please get in touch via <a href='mailto:inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a> or one of our organizing team directly.</p>

                <p>The venue has ground floor access to the plenary room, and lift access to other rooms, these being on a single floor. Packed lunch and refreshments will be served on the ground floor.</p>

                <p>Bathrooms are available on each floor. Free parking is available near the ground floor venue entrance, off College Park (end of Botanic Avenue), beside the entrance to the Botanic Gardens. Early arrival to ensure parking availability is recommended, although the event is outside university term time and on the weekend, so a lower level of space contention is expected than otherwise. We are waiting confirmation of the best stair-free access route to the building from College Park with the venue; at present, it is via the left-hand side of the Administration Building, which faces the College Park carpark, through the archway near the Physics and crossing the quad to the opposite wing.</p>

                <p>Carers are welcome free-of-charge - our system will allow self-selected ticket booking at zero cost, but if preferred, you are welcome to contact us to book a ticket for a carer directly.</p>

                <p>While we will not be able to provide live captioning, if you would be benefited by suitable seat reservation, or there are other ways we can facilitate your experience of the event, please get in touch via <a href='mailto:inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a> or one of our organizing team directly. We do have some preparation space that may be used as a quieter area, however, if find you need access to a suitable space during the day, please let one of our organizing team know.</p>

                <h3>Public transport</h3>

                <p>A Belfast Bikes stand is near to the entrance, beside the Botanic Gardens entrance off Botanic Avenue. Bicycle stands are available. Train access is via Botanic Station, approximately 500m from the venue. Buses are available from the city centre (e.g. Great Victoria Street) stopping near the corner of Botanic Avenue and University Avenue, approximately 40m from the venue. These include 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d Translink Metro services.</p>

                <p>If there is information that you feel should be here, but is not, please let us know at <a href='inbox@nidevconf.com'>inbox@nidevconf.com</a>.</p>
