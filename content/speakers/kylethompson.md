Kyle is as a Solution Architect at Kainos involved in changing how government delivers digital services that help us all. Over the last 10 years he has evolved from developer to architect and has experienced the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of architecture boards, technical design authorities and architecture approval groups.

Kyleâ€™s daily struggle is balancing the responsibilities of the broader view of the architect with hands on experience of following through on the architectural vision to create happy teams who provide quality functional and non-functional delivery.
