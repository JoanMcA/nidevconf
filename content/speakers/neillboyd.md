Neill is a quality focused engineer trying to redefine how Flexera 'do quality'. Neill has tried to bring good test practices to teams across many sectors, from FinTech to Software Analysis and everything in between. With close to 15 years in this game, if Neill isn't talking about testing and quality at some level, then he more than likely isn't feeling very well. When not disproving assumptions about software, Neill is at home with his daughter Alex or attempting to learn something new (magic, instruments, technology).
