I'm a full-time senior UI developer for Moo.la, a financial website startup based in Belfast and London. Prior to this I was the Head of Frontend Development at +rehabstudio, operating out of their Belfast office. I am also a co-organiser of (and occasional speaker at) the local BelfastJS meetup group. I'm a 'web guy' and am passionate about building for the Web, performance, user experience and keeping things clean and fast. I'm also an occasional musician and game jammer who wishes it was easier to do both in the browser.
