Cut his teeth as a BOFH in the early 2000s and found a passion for trying to break things. After teaching himself how to code (badly) he moved to Northern Ireland in 2010 to pursue a career as an automation engineer.

Currently enjoying his time at Bazaarvoice being encouraged to try new things outside his usual comfort zone like speaking here.
