Kevin Beimers runs Northern Irish indie studio Italic Pig, and is the creator/director of award-nominated quantum physics puzzler platformer Schrödinger’s Cat and the Raiders of the Lost Quark, unofficial winner of Best Title For A Video Game Ever. He also co-created Hector: Badge of Carnage, and he’s not even embarrassed about it.

Italic Pig has a great steaming pile of games in development, most notably Mona Lisa – an art heist and forgery adventure set in the Renaissance. Mona Lisa recently won PocketGamer’s Very Big Indie Pitch, and was nominated for Best Storytelling, Best Quality of Art and Most Creative & Original Concept. 

In his past, Kevin’s had an office on the 73rd floor of the Empire State Building, rode a tricycle around Australia, and once attended Oktoberfest with Miss Arkansas (all true). His weapon of choice is the non sequitur, followed closely by a BFG9000 made out of Lego.
