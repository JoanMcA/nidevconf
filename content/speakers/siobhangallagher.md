OWASP Chapter Leader, PWC Cyber Business Lead for NI, Women in Tech Exec member, keen supporter of getting women and kids into tech/STEM, Bring IT On ambassador, 15+ years tech sales & business development experience, avid techie meetup attendee in the hope that some techie genius will rub off on me, massive supporter of the NI Tech Community and initiatives like this. And finally - someone who believes we'd all do better if sales and techies could understand each other a little more.
