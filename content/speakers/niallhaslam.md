My background is originally in genetics (DNA sequencing) and I've always been interested in the intersection of computers and biology. I've held a wide variety of jobs from manufacturing antibiotics to measuring performance in a derivatives exchange. I've also worked in a variety of different companies from nomad consultants to large corporate organisations and bring the experience from those to any new project. Most of all though I enjoy tinkering with new tech and learning more about how the world works.
