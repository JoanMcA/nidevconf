Paddy is a Senior Engineer at ShopKeep in Belfast, leading a small team that focusses on meeting the complex reporting needs of merchants on the ShopKeep platform. Paddy is the organiser of a number of local meetups, trying to help increase collaboration and sharing within the local tech community. He can often be found in his shed late at night, trying to debug some ill-advised piece of code with his [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) that, honestly, he probably should never have written in the first place.
