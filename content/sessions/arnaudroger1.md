SimpleFlatMapper is a library I developed, that sole focus is mapping flat structure to object trees. It can map a ResultSet, a jOOQ Record, a CSV, a POI excel spreadsheet to an object with a very limited amount of code, support for any kind of injection Field, Setter, Constructor, Builder pattern, Factory method and even allow you to map one-to-many relationship. Stop writing your own RowMapper and focus and the business logic.
