Deep learning is pushing the frontiers of what computers can do. Areas previously thought to be the realm of human creativity are being encroached on by silicon. If image recognition, voice detection seems impressive, wait till you see neural nets generating art, and television scripts. In this talk, we'll take a look at some examples of what can be achieved with relative ease using tools like Tensorflow, and a few lines of Python (and a GPU).
