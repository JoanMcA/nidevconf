A fast-paced overview of the value and real world applications of incorporating geospatial technologies.

The geo-services industry (think location based search, electronic maps, satellite navigation) is estimated to be six times larger than the video games industry and is a component of emerging ecosystems such as augmented reality, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles. This faced pace talk will highlight real world geo-service industry examples – such as UBER’s highest query per second micro-service (geo-fence) built using GO – and related practical tools that developers can utilise – such as leaflet, the open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps, or the next generation of location accuracy APIs.
