This talk is about how we converted our internal facing product platform which met our company's internal needs to an external facing Platform as a Service, which other companies and enterprises can leverage to meet and enhance their customers' needs. We'll talk about how we did it, the lessons learned in that process and the best practices of exposing APIs through cloud and how to secure those APIs.
