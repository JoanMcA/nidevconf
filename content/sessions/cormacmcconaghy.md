The OpenDataNI portal went live in November 2015. 19 months later we have seen steady growth in its use and achieved some significant successes including the recent ODNI4EDU education challenge.  This is an opportunity to make the wider NI developer community aware of the ODNI portal, its role in trying to stimulate innovation and opportunities for the dev community to become involved with Open Data in Northern Ireland.
