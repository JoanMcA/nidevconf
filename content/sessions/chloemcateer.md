I have recently realised the importance of taking as many opportunities as possible especially as a student. In the tech industry there are so many different ways to get involved in the local community, such as going to hackathons, meet ups or even conferences. All of these are great for finding other people in similar situations to yourself or finding people to learn from. Throughout my talk I want to explain why this is so important and my experiences in getting involved.
