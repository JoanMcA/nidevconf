User Interface and User Experience are so entangled in VR, and as a developer you can affect more than you think from within the Engine. Like good code standards, we should take pride in only producing VR games which implement good basic practice for user comfort, and all the major manufacturers have issued best practice guidelines. This presentation takes a look at some of the new challenges VR presents, and how you can compensate for them in your code and in your design. Forewarned is forearmed.
