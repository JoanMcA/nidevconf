The emphasis has changed from Hadoop, to Spark and now onto streaming data in near realtime with applications such as Kafka and Kinesis. In this talk Jason Bell, of Mastodon C, will share his experiences in designing and deploying a large scale streaming application. From the paper planning, how he practically took a workflow framework to the edge and how open source saved him. Limavady, once the home to Big Data is now also the home to large scale streaming applications.

In a tale of intrigue, zip files, heartbeat latency and untold riches along the way, Jason will share his story of how large scale data pipelines became his destiny.
