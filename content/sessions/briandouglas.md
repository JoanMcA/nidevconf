In this session I'll take you through my journey analysing IoT Data in R and Python, weighing up the merits of each. 
I'll also share 3 methods that leverage open source software to quickly generate animating graphs from live IoT sensor data in Jupyter Notebooks. We'll start with an easy method to generate simple graphs that animate and progress to highly customisable animating graphs that require a bit more effort.
