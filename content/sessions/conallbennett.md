Warning to all developers, this talk involve many emphatic and graphic references to testing! 

Whats all the fuss with serverless architecture? If you listen to some, it is the future of architecture implementation and is disrupting DevOps, traditional application implementation models, enterprise approaches to IT, and entry to and time to market. Tech giants like Netflix, AWS, Google and others are leading the charge with this technology adoption. 

This talk is an experience report on how our team fell into a serverless implementation without any real experience of the technology and how we learned about it along the way. The talk will give a brief overview of what serverless is and its benefits and how we went from sceptics of it initially to advocates for it along our journey of exploration. 

I will talk about our team test first mentality and the multiple functional and non-functional approaches and patterns we applied to serverless, as well as the existing challenges of testing it. That will include how we ran exploratory performance tests to determine and quantify language deficiencies on the platform in order to help drive our implementation approach.
