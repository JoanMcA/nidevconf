When BDNA Belfast set out to redesign the Silicon Valley company's core data platform, the team encountered a data modelling challenge vastly different from anything we had seen before - the need for a structured, flexible taxonomy containing a highly-relational dataset with the ability to scale.

In this talk, Pawel Niemiec (Senior Data Engineer) and Phil Wilkinson (Site Lead) will discuss how BDNA's new Belfast engineering team developed a solution to this problem using graph theory and will present a technical overview of how the team have built a platform that will enable BDNA to scale to the next phase of its roadmapâ€¦ IoT.

The talk will touch on high-level thoughts on relational vs graph data stores as well as a technical dive into Cassandra.
