I'd like to propose a talk on how a team of web developers, thanks to React Native, built an app for the iOS platform using the web technologies we know and love.

React Native is a framework from Facebook that allows apps to be built in React and Javascript which are indistinguishable from those built in Java or Objective-C. I look at why it's not just another HTML5 'hybrid' solution in the vein of Cordova, but something more powerful which combines the advantages of web technologies with that of the target platform. I talk about why we took a chance on it and why on the whole it has turned out to be a sound choice despite some challenges along the way.
