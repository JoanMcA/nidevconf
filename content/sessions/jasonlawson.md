Agile development has led to increased communication and collaboration within more diverse teams.  With that positive shift comes plenty of opportunity for misinterpretation, misunderstanding and stressed relationships.

Analogies are a great tool for communicating complex ideas & concepts in a way that everyone can understand their value.  They can even be fun and entertaining.
