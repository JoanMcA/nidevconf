I would like to propose a lightning talk that discusses communication by highlighting how the usage of analogies can result in effective communication with people from differing perspectives and levels of technical expertise.

As an example I will use the analogy of refactoring code as a restaurant kitchen to demonstrate how this can lead to a common understanding between Business and IT in terms of the business value of and need for refactoring, thus mitigating the tension that can arise between partners over this subject. I wrote a short blog on this: https://medium.com/@jaselawson/refactoring-kitchen-nightmares-6f6c36ebf9c3 

I'd hope people would take away not just the refactoring analogy itself but also the idea of finding a common reference/understanding with their partners as an important strategy for addressing dissonance, building relationships and effective communication.
