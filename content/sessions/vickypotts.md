Hi there! I did a talk on 'Student to Startup' last year. I'd like to do my 'I've levelled up a wee bit' talk - which is about the NI Game Dev scene in Northern Ireland and the tools that we use, for those who may not even know such a scene exists. 

The talk will roughly cover the following:

The Job of a Games Developer
Training & Skills Needed
What Do Games Companies Look For
What Development Software is Useful
Journey to Whitepot
The NI Games Development Industry
