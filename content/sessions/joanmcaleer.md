For some reason in this day and age children seem to be almost the kryptonite  to any career in IT male or female. Since having a child and returning to work the amount of males and females (not just in my own work) who have spoken to me asking questions that they are afraid to ask their employers or speak to their co-workers for feat of no longer being seen as committed to their career. I'd like to address some of those questions for everyone to hear.
