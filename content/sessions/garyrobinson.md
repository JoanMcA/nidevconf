Security teams like to complain about how software teams don't take security seriously.  Well in this talk we are going to turn the tables and explain how the security industry doesn't understand how software is really developed.  We will flag problems with the way security teams approach and handle security.  

We will then talk about ways in which development and security teams can work better together, drawing on research and practices developed around the world that are proven to work.
