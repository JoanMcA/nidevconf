When you move into an architect role, it’s easy to get sucked into the Ivory Tower pattern of behaviour. This talk is about my own journey from developer to architect and how I’ve tried to balance the paradox of remaining relevant whilst dealing with the typical enterprise architect responsibilities.

I’ll cover some of the standard demands you might face with this dichotomy, for example, everyone wanting meetings all of the time, or being asked for estimates for a thing you won’t be building and methods that I’ve found to be either effective or ineffective in dealing with those demands.
