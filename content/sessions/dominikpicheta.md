Nim is a young systems programming language that is incredibly fast,
easy to learn, and fun to use. What sets it apart from other languages is
its incredible flexibility, provided by the most extensive metaprogramming
support of any language. Nim code is compiled into small and dependency free
binaries, with program memory managed manually or using a garbage
collector.

In this talk I will introduce you to Nim, explaining its features, showcasing
some Nim software and
describing the state of the project. Nim is an open source project, developed
and supported entirely by volunteers, we need your help to make it succeed.
By the end of this talk you should have a good grasp of what Nim's defining
features are and how to get started with it.
