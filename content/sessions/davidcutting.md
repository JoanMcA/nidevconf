In 2008 I replaced a bunch of disconnected ageing scripts that monitored my servers with a single simple network monitor... and released it open source in case anyone (or two) might use it. Over the next ten years it grew thanks to free community involvement both in terms of testing, suggestions, code submissions, community support, and everything else. Along the way it's spawned two independent FOSS projects which are spun-off components of the monitor which have their own lives now.

This talk will be a brief journey through this story and the lessons I've learnt that encourage me to release everything I can as FOSS - mainly to help me build the product if for no other reason!
