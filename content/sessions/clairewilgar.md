This talk will focus on Design/Component Libraries - basically a set of design rules and standardised/templated UI components for a project.

It will discuss the potential benefits of using this sort of system and why it’s worth considering and has gained in popularity. It will also cover the potential problems with these systems depending on how they are implemented, and what should be avoided to make sure you don’t over-complicate your system, make development more difficult or encourage bad standards.

By the end of this talk, the audience should have a reasonable idea of whether or not a style guide and component library would be a good tool for their project/product, and what steps they should take to ensure the addition does not create problems or complexities more than necessary.
