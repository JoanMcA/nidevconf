The aim of the talk is to  show developers how to leap from only working with software, to diving into the fascinating world of Internet of Things.

In this session Allen will talk about many things: the engineers urge to scratch an itch, systems analysis, reverse engineering, decomposition, making leaps (big ones and small ones), but most importantly, lessons learned, and his adventures in learning to how to build a robot!
