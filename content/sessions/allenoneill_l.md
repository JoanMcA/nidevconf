There's a lot of discussion about diversity in the tech sector, but it's not really about diversity, it's about inclusion. If we get inclusion right, the diversity and its benefits will follow. This quick session will give you some different ways of looking at things, and offer practical tips based on real-world experience to help make a better, more inclusive and diverse workplace.

This talk is inspired by what Allen learned at a talk by Microsoft about the practical steps they've taken that have had a positive outcome on the diversity of their teams.
