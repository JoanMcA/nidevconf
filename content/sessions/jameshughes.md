I mean the title kind of captures the essence of the talk but at its core this talk will be about how I over-engineered a data pipeline using Clojure and Neo4j (among other things) so that I could play about with relationships between board games.  Why would I do this? To be honest I don't know but I did so I may as well talk about it right? I mean I could spin this as a deep insight into architecting resilient, fault tolerant data pipelines using cutting edge technology but what do I know?
