The agenda for the Open Space will be generated during the lunch-time introduction. You are encouraged to come along, find out more and help set the afternoon agenda during the pre-lightning talk open space opening, as well as joining the discussions themselves across the afternoon.

Signage will be updated through the day to indicate with the Open Space timing will be. Throughout the day, the Law of Two Feet applies: you are welcome to enter and leave this room during discussion and talks, so please explore the space!

The Open Space is inspired and organised by [Liberty IT](https://www.liberty-it.co.uk/).
