As technology progresses, we’re seeing a greater emphasis of interpersonal skills on people in their jobs (I’m not going to discuss whether AI will replace your job) - but I don’t think the robots will be successful until we maximise their interpersonal skills too. We want software that was made by and for humans. And when it comes to human computer interaction, the most natural way for humans to interact is with language. In my talk, I’ll discuss why chatbots have so much potential, and the “personality traits” needed to make a successful chatbot.
