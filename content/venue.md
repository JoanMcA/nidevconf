                <p>
                    Buses are available from the city centre (e.g. Great Victoria Street) stopping near the corner of Botanic Avenue and University Avenue, approximately 40m from the venue. These include 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d Translink Metro services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Free parking is available near the ground floor venue entrance, off Botanic Avenue, beside the entrance to the Botanic Gardens. Early arrival to ensure parking availability is recommended, although the event is outside university term time and on the weekend, so a lower level of space contention is expected than otherwise.
