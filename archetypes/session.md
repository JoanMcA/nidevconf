A VC funded start-up led by a Belfast born native are set about to revolutionise communication between the financial centres of the world, but at the same time they have to pioneer new science, broker peace between two nations recently engaged in a bitter war, harness the power of the largest machine ever built. And do all this in a lean, agile way bringing fundamental researchers, engineering and live site operators together on the same boat on the same one-shot journey across previously uncharted waters. Oh yeah – and this happened 150 years ago. Find out what lessons we can learn today from the beginning of the first communications revolution of the industrial age.
